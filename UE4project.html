        <h1>As a Unreal Engine 4 beginner</h1>
        <p>Unreal Engine 4 is a powerful game engine that is developed by the Epic Games. At the beginning, the engine is designed specifically for first-personal shooter games. 
            After generations, the Unreal Engine today can be used in creating games in various genres, such as stealth games, 
            RPGs and platformers which is the type of game that I am creating.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>Unreal Engine is written in C++ and being able to support different platforms. Even though I am self-learning about C++, 
            I had a great time with the blueprint coding to create the game I want by achieving customized game elements, player abilities, etc.</p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>The best way to understand video games is definitely by creating one. In the process, I acquired solid knowledge in solving problems, such as debugging and creating a specific function. Apart from that, I am also accumulating knowledge about level design and environmental art during the creation process.</p>
